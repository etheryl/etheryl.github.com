<strong>Approach: A rich feature set but easy to use</strong>
<p>
  Etheryl's complete feature list allows you to get started right away in managing your community.  It includes all the important elements so that users can start contributing right away.  You can also move onto more advanced uses such as e-mail broadcasting and subscription .  We also know that too many features at once are confusing.  Getting used to a complex new tool alone can lead to disuse.  That's why we've build each feature to be intuitive and to have a standardized navigation.
