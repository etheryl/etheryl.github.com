  Corporate social networks can embrace internal networks varying from vertical communities of practice in one function to horizontal communities of interest.  The key to tie the members together in a way that allows more efficiencies in collaboration, knowledge sharing, and cross-organizational networking.

  Etheryl helps you design the community by carefully helping you select the appropriate features and their configurations.  No two communities are alike.  A community of 1000 interns is not the same as a highly focused research group of 50 engineers.  Each community has its own size, rhythm of communication, governance, and tools.  Etheryl allows you to customize for each.

  Social media has been big in online marketing.  However, what will you do with 1000 fans on a public social network site?  The real issue is conversion.  How do you convert a “fan” into a consumer.  Embracing a community of expert “influencers” who indirectly sway the end buyer is a savvy way to communicate about your products.

  Etheryl can help you build a customized, branded site around the influencers in your ecosystem in order to increase your conversion.
